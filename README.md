# Installing and Running Docker Container

After installing and running the first container using Docker, we&#39;ve experienced software and all of its components within the image being deployed to a cloud through a container. The packages and dependencies are being ran together and sharing the OS kernel with another containers. For the default container, the command that we used is running docker and telling the daemon to start container in detached mode, meaning that its running in the background. Next it, maps the container to network ports:8080 and runs the image, docker/getting-started. The virtual machine that we used to install Docker allows us to run the software within our operating system.
